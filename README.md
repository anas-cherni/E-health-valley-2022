# E-health-valley-2022
I Coded this project during 24h hackathon "E-health Valley 2k22" and managed to spot 1st place after a successful pitching session.
Every folder in this repo contains a custom dashboard for each specific organisation.

The solution consists of automating workflow between institutions engaged in the supply chain of medicines.
The main objective was to anticipate the shortage of supply through an intelligent system of alerting.


I managed to deliver a proof of concept, I literally took about 5 hours in analyzing the real needs and issues to solve (with my team LastHour) and coded for more than 15 hours straight. What a sleepless night!
